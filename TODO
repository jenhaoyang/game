For engine stuff only (we'll worry about the game part later)

Figure out what other stuff should be in the engine (Keep it as simple as possible)

Come up with a good collision system
    - Should be able to set rules for different types of collisions without having to do type casting (hopefully)
    - Makes sense to be object oriented, with possibly different types of collision functions for polymorphism

Fix colliding with ground
    - The player should stop when coming from any direction (velocity should change depending on direction)

Separate "game" from "engine" (this one is a bit more optional, it would be nice, but don't waste time here)
    - Things like states and Entities should be put in different files
    - Engine should be dynamically linked or staticly linked depending on compile flags

Order Undecided:
    Markers
    Area loading
    Enemies
    Graphics and Sound loading
    Level editor and recognizer
    Attacking
    better movement
    Collisions with everything
